Paragraph on findings:
Initially when I began to analyze this data set and thinking about the culture of music, I hypothesized that
Since hip-hop artists are constantly in the forefront of social media, this would reflect on the most popular songs on spotify.
In order to test this theory I wanted to specifically analyze the genre and artists of the top 15 most popular songs in the dataset. 
To my surprise, latino artists clearly had the biggest impact on the spotify charts and even expanding my search results above 15, the 
the same lantino artists would appear such as Bad Bunny and David Guetta. I can confidently say that my hypothesis was incorrect and that latino
dance/reggaeton music is the most popular genre on spotify.
